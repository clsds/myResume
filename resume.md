# Projects and Results
- 2019.10-2020.01 Basic Operation of Microcontroller (Self-taught)  
  During the winter vacation, I purchased a small MCU developing board, with which I taught myself the basic  
  operation of Microcontroller. Applying the software Keil, I coded with my classmates and then programmed it  
  into the controller through STC-ISP, realizing the application of a self-tracing robot. This experience has  
  greatly cultivated my abilities of independent learning, problem solving, as well as logic for programming.
